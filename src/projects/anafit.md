Anafit is a visual curve fitting tool for Matplotlib. It allows you to fit a curve to your data by interactively adjusting the parameters of the model. It is designed to be easy to use and to provide immediate feedback on the quality of the fit. Anafit is built on top of `matplotlib` and uses the `scipy` library for curve fitting. It is open source and [available on GitHub](https://github.com/xamcost/anafit).
